# Dynamo Package Management

## Note

Packages are collections of custom nodes that extend Dynamo's functionality. While powerful, they need to be managed carefully.

- **Finding Packages:** The Dynamo Package Manager is the best place to find and install packages.
- **Version Conflicts:** Be aware that packages can have version conflicts with each other or with the version of Revit and Dynamo you are using.
- **Project Dependencies:** When sharing a Dynamo graph, you also need to share the list of required packages and their versions.
