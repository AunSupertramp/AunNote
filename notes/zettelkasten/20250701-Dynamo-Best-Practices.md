# Dynamo Best Practices

## Note

To ensure your Dynamo graphs are efficient, readable, and maintainable, it's important to follow some best practices.

- **Grouping and Naming:** Group related nodes together and give them clear, descriptive names. This makes the graph much easier to understand for yourself and others.
- **Use Notes:** Add notes to complex parts of your graph to explain the logic.
- **Code Blocks:** Use code blocks for simple operations instead of multiple nodes. For more complex logic, consider using Python.
- **Package Management:** Be mindful of the packages you use. Too many packages can slow down Dynamo and create dependency issues.
