# Introduction to Rail and Track Modeling

## Note

Rail and Track Modeling is a specialized discipline within Building Information Modeling (BIM) focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of railway infrastructure. It involves creating a detailed 3D digital model of all components of the railway system.

This digital model serves as a single source of truth for all project stakeholders and is used for:
- Detailed design and engineering.
- Clash detection and coordination.
- Construction sequencing and planning (4D BIM).
- Cost estimation (5D BIM).
- Asset management and maintenance throughout the railway's lifecycle.
