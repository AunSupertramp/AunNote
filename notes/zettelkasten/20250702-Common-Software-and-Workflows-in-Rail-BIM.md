# Common Software and Workflows in Rail BIM

## Note

Rail modeling relies on specialized software designed for linear infrastructure.

- **Primary Design Tools:**
  - **Bentley OpenRail Designer:** A leading, comprehensive tool for rail design and modeling.
  - **Autodesk Civil 3D:** Widely used for corridor modeling, which is the foundation of track design. Often used with the Rail subassembly library.
  - **Trimble Quantm:** Used for route optimization and alignment planning.

- **Coordination and Review Tools:**
  - **Autodesk Navisworks:** For clash detection and model aggregation from different disciplines.
  - **Bentley iTwin:** For digital twin creation and review.

- **General BIM Tools:**
  - **Autodesk Revit:** Used for modeling vertical structures like stations, bridges, and tunnels.

A common workflow involves creating the track alignment in a tool like OpenRail or Civil 3D, then federating that model with structures from Revit in a platform like Navisworks.
