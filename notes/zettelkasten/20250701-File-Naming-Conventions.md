# Practical File Naming Conventions

## Note

A consistent file naming convention is crucial for project organization and efficiency. A good system makes it easy to find what you are looking for and understand the contents of a file without opening it.

A practical approach for project-based work:

**`YYYYMMDD-[ProjectCode]-[Discipline]-[Description]-[Version].ext`**

- **`YYYYMMDD`**: Date of creation or last modification. This allows for easy chronological sorting.
- **`ProjectCode`**: A short, unique code for the project (e.g., "Project-X").
- **`Discipline`**: A code for the discipline (e.g., ARC for Architecture, STR for Structural).
- **`Description`**: A brief, descriptive name of the file's content (e.g., "Level-01-Floor-Plan").
- **`Version`**: (Optional) A version number (e.g., "v01", "v02").

Example: `20250701-ProjectX-ARC-Level-01-Floor-Plan-v03.dwg`
