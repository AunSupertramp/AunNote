# Python Scripting in Dynamo

## Note

While Dynamo's nodes are powerful, sometimes you need more flexibility. The Python Script node allows you to write custom Python code to perform complex operations, interact with the Revit API directly, and create logic that would be difficult to represent visually.

This is particularly useful for:
- Looping and iteration.
- Complex conditional logic.
- Accessing parts of the Revit API not exposed by default nodes.
