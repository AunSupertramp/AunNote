# Introduction to Revit Dynamo

## Note

Dynamo is a visual programming tool that works with Revit. It allows for the automation of repetitive tasks, the creation of complex geometry, and the ability to access and manipulate Revit's data and elements. It's a powerful way to extend the capabilities of Revit beyond what is available through the standard user interface.

Key benefits of using Dynamo:
- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like creating sheets, views, and parameters.
- **Complex Geometry:** Create complex geometric forms that would be difficult to model manually.
- **Data Management:** Extract data from a Revit model for analysis or to be used in other applications.
- **Interoperability:** Connect Revit to other applications and data sources.
