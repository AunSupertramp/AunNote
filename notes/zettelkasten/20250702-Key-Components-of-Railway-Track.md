# Key Components of Railway Track

## Note

A railway track is a complex structure with several key components working together to support trains.

- **Rails:** The steel profiles that the train wheels run on.
- **Sleepers (or Ties):** The transverse beams (usually concrete or wood) that hold the rails at the correct distance (gauge).
- **Ballast:** The bed of crushed stone that the sleepers are laid on. It provides drainage and distributes the load.
- **Fastening System:** Clips, spikes, and pads that fix the rails to the sleepers.
- **Switches and Crossings (Turnouts):** Mechanical installations that guide trains from one track to another.
