# Fundamental Rail Design Concepts

## Note

Several key geometric concepts govern the design of a railway.

- **Track Alignment:** The 3D path of the track, defined by horizontal (curves) and vertical (gradients) alignments.
- **Track Gauge:** The distance between the inner faces of the two rails. This is a critical standard (e.g., Standard Gauge is 1,435 mm).
- **Cant (or Superelevation):** The raising of the outer rail on a curve. This counteracts centrifugal force, improving safety and passenger comfort.
- **Gradient:** The rate of rise or fall of the track, expressed as a percentage or ratio.
